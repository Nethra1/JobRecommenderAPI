We believe that we are better together, and at Tripadvisor we welcome you for who you are. Our workplace is for everyone, as is our people powered platform. At Tripadvisor, we want you to bring your unique identities, abilities, and experiences, so we can collectively revolutionize travel and together find the good out there.


     Tripadvisor is the largest travel site in the world, visited by over 500 million travellers each month.
   





The Ottawa office is looking for software engineering co-ops to join our team for summer 2022.
 A Tripadvisor Intern Program provides real world experience as part of a world-class engineering team, along with an excellent salary and other perks. Several of our former interns have gone on to being full-time members of the Engineering team.
 We have a fun and friendly environment where the key objective is getting things done. Our engineers are part of the full process from design, to code, to test, to deployment, and back again for further iteration.
 Across Tripadvisor, we've worked hard to create an atmosphere of ""Speed Wins"" – minimizing process, shipping products quickly, and doing everything to avoid big company paralysis. This is a very bottom-up organization; there are no software architects thinking deep thoughts and dictating the action from above. We trust our engineers to come up with, implement, and take responsibility for their own designs.
 Do you want to build features end to end? Do you want to work with a large number of technologies? Do you want to work in an environment where things move quickly, features are released daily and you're working with other smart and talented engineers? If this sounds like you, we would love to talk to you.
 What you'll do


Code! Most of our engineers release code to production every few days


Real work! From day one, Tripadvisor interns work on the same tasks as our main Engineering team.


Learn! You'll be assigned a dedicated mentor and work alongside bright and skilled engineers with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.


Collaborate! We have engineering groups located around the world. We're working with teams in the US, Europe and Mexico!


Operate across our evolving technology stack - we're using Java, React, Microservices, AWS, GraphQL, Elasticsearch, Knowledge Graphs and more!


Take responsibility for all aspects of software engineering, from design to implementation, QA, and maintenance.


Touch code at many different levels



 What we're looking for

Students working towards a degree in Computer Science or a similar discipline. You do need to be confident writing code in at least one object-oriented language.


Willingness and ability to take on new technologies. You do not need to have experience with all the technologies listed above, but you do need to be hungry to learn.


Ability to break down complex problems into simple solutions.


Strong analytical skills and desire to write clean, correct, and efficient code.


High quality verbal and written communication skills.


A sense of ownership, urgency, and pride in your work.



 What will be the duration
 A four months co-op program from May to August 2022




We strive to create an accessible and inclusive experience for all candidates. If you need a reasonable accommodation during the application or the recruiting process, please make sure to reach out to your individual recruiter or our team at greenhouse@tripadvisor.com.
